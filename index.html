          I am a Junior Software Developer with a background in Nursing. I am
          skilled in CSS and React and enjoy working as part of a team or
          independently. I thrive when I am faced with challenges, and I am an
          excellent problem solver. What excites me the most about coding is the
          constant challenges and problems that require you to stop and think
          through them. I am highly motivated and keen to continue developing my
          skills and experience.
